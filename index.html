            <p id="p">"Mudrarakshasa" is a Sanskrit play composed by Visakhadatta in the early 7th century. Spanning over a year, the story is purely a political drama minus a female protagonist. The theme of the play is mainly about the elevation of Chandragupta
                Maurya to the royal throne of Magadha. It also highlights the means of winning over of Rakshasa, the hostile minister of Dhanananda to the side of Chandragupta, followed by the measures to strengthen the rule of the Mauryas by Chanakya.
                Being a historical and political drama, "Mudrarakshasa" represents a curious state of public morals wherein methods such as fraud are assassination are used as the simplest means to remove inconvenient obligations to uproot troublesome
                allies and have open enemies removed. I must clarify that though such acts are not held in themselves as crimes or that their perpetrators, if instigated by vice or ferocity, are not condemned as culprits, it is only the commission of
                the crime proposes a political end that it is represented as venial, and is compatible with an amiable goal.</p>
